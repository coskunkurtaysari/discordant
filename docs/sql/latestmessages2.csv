The email will include:
- A detailed report on the current system status.
- A summary of the issue encountered with the n8n instance.
- Steps taken to resolve the issue and prevent future occurrences.
- Contact information for direct support should you have further questions or concerns.

**🔄 Next Steps:**
1. **Email Preparation**: The email is being drafted with the latest system status information.
