- Lists: `- item` or `1. item`
- Links: `[text](url)`
- Code: `` `code` `` or ``` for blocks
- Tables: Standard markdown table syntax
- Line breaks: Use actual line breaks, not `\n`

### Examples of CORRECT formatting:
```

- Important point one
- Important point two

**Next Steps:**
1. Action item one
2. Action item two

**External Links:**
