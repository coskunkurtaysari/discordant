    "call": {
      "id": "call_123",
      "status": "ended",
      "transcript": "user: I need a website for my business\nassistant: I'd be happy to help with that. What type of business do you have?",
      "duration": "00:03:45"
    },
    "customer": {
      "number": "+1234567890"
    }
  }
}
```

### Lead Quality Scoring

The system uses keyword analysis to score leads:

```javascript

['budget', 'timeline', 'project', 'hire', 'contract', 'deadline', 'launch']

// Medium Quality Keywords  
['interested', 'tell me more', 'pricing', 'cost', 'quote']

// Low Quality Keywords
['just browsing', 'maybe', 'thinking about', 'someday']
```

### Service Detection

Automatically detects interest in:
- Full-Stack Development
- AI Integration
- Mobile Development
- E-commerce Solutions
- Consulting Services
- Custom Software

### Calendar Scheduling Logic

1. **Parse customer request** for preferred date/time
2. **Check calendar availability** using Google Calendar API
3. **Find optimal time slot** avoiding conflicts
4. **Create meeting** with Google Meet link
5. **Send invitations** to both parties
6. **Set reminders** (24 hours and 15 minutes before)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Calendar Permission Errors**
   - Verify service account has calendar access
   - Check that calendar is shared with service account email

2. **Email Sending Failures**
   - Confirm Gmail app password is correct
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled on Google account

3. **VAPI Webhook Not Receiving**
   - Check webhook URL in VAPI dashboard
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

4. **Discord System Messages Not Appearing**
   - Confirm "Code with KenDev" server exists
   - Verify #system channel is present
   - Check database connection

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging by checking:
- Browser console for frontend errors
- Server logs for API endpoint responses
- VAPI dashboard for webhook delivery status
- n8n execution logs for workflow processing

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: All sensitive keys stored as environment variables
- **Domain Whitelisting**: CORS proxy only allows approved domains
- **Email Validation**: Customer email addresses are validated before sending
- **Calendar Permissions**: Service account has minimal required permissions
- **Webhook Verification**: VAPI webhook signatures should be verified (implement as needed)

## Future Enhancements

1. **CRM Integration**: Automatic lead creation in popular CRM systems
2. **SMS Notifications**: Text message alerts for high-priority leads
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual reporting of call metrics and conversion rates
4. **Multi-language Support**: Extend AI assistant to handle multiple languages
5. **Lead Scoring ML**: Machine learning model for more accurate lead qualification
6. **Outbound Campaign Management**: Automated follow-up sequences based on lead behavior
