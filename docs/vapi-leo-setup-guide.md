# VAPI Leo Assistant Setup Guide

## Part 4: Testing & Verification

### Test the Webhook Endpoint

Run the provided test script:

```powershell
# For local development
./test-vapi-webhook.ps1

# For production
# Edit the script to use https://discordant.kendev.co
```

### Test Assistant Creation

Use the API endpoint to create/update Leo:

```bash
# Create new assistant
curl -X POST https://discordant.kendev.co/api/voice-ai/vapi/assistant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "create"}'

# Update existing assistant
curl -X POST https://discordant.kendev.co/api/voice-ai/vapi/assistant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "update", "assistantId": "your-assistant-id"}'
```

### Test with Real Calls

1. **Use VAPI dashboard** to initiate test calls
2. **Monitor Discord** `#folio-site-assistant` channel for notifications
3. **Check n8n workflows** for automation triggers
4. **Verify contact capture** in external messages

## Part 5: Integration Flow

When Leo is called, here's what happens:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming Call] --> B[Leo Answers]
    B --> C[Conversation with Prospect]
    C --> D[Function Called]
    D --> E[Webhook to Discordant]
    E --> F[Process Function]
    F --> G[Store in Database]
    F --> H[Discord Notification]
    F --> I[Trigger n8n Workflow]
    I --> J[Send Email/Calendar/CRM]
    E --> K[Return Response to Leo]
    K --> L[Leo Speaks Response]
```

## Part 6: Monitoring & Analytics

### Discord Notifications

All VAPI activities are logged to:
- `#system` - System events and errors
- `#folio-site-assistant` - Contact captures and leads

### Function Call Analytics

Monitor the webhook logs:
```bash
# Check webhook responses
curl https://discordant.kendev.co/api/voice-ai/vapi/webhook
```

### Call Records

Access call data via VAPI API:
```bash
# Get assistant info
curl https://discordant.kendev.co/api/voice-ai/vapi/assistant
```

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Functions not working**: Check server URL and secret
2. **No Discord notifications**: Verify n8n webhook URLs
3. **Contact info not saving**: Check database connection
4. **Calendar not scheduling**: Verify calendar integration

### Debug Steps

1. **Test webhook directly** with test script
2. **Check environment variables** in production
3. **Monitor Discord logs** for error messages
4. **Verify VAPI dashboard** function configuration

## Part 8: Production Deployment

### Environment Checklist

- âœ… `VAPI_API_KEY` set in production
- âœ… `VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` matches dashboard
- âœ… `VAPI_SERVER_SECRET` configured
- âœ… Webhook URL accessible from VAPI
- âœ… n8n workflows active
- âœ… Discord integration working

### Go-Live Steps

1. **Update assistant ID** in environment variables
2. **Test with real phone number**
3. **Verify all integrations** working
4. **Monitor first few calls** closely
5. **Iterate based on results**

## Success Metrics

- ðŸ“ž **Call Conversion Rate**: Percentage of calls that capture contact info
- ðŸ“§ **Email Capture Rate**: Percentage with valid email addresses
- ðŸ“… **Consultation Booking Rate**: Percentage that schedule meetings
- ðŸŽ¯ **Lead Quality Score**: Based on project type and budget
- âš¡ **Response Time**: Average webhook processing time

## Next Steps

3. **Integrate CRM** for complete lead management
4. **Add analytics dashboard** for call performance
5. **Scale to multiple phone numbers** and campaigns
