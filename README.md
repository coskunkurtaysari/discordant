## Origin

This project builds upon the foundational concepts in Code with Antonio's Discord Clone. Antonio's videos are invaluable learning resources, and while much of his content is behind a paywall, this repository provides an accessible way for developers to explore, learn, and expand their skills. This effort aligns with similar projects, including:

- Next LMS Clone
- Notion Clone
- NextJS Commerce Site and Admin Dashboard
- AirBNB Clone
- KenDev Taskify (Trello Clone)
- Payload CMS repositories

The ultimate goal is to integrate this Discord Clone with **Payload CMS 3.0**, unlocking advanced features like collection hooks and deeper content management capabilities.
